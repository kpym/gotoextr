# hist2geo
Small and durty program to extract GPX data from Google Location History.

## Usage

1. Download your location history from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) as `zip` archive.
2. Run `hist2geo` with the downloaded archive as argument. For example to extract data for January 1, 2023 run:
```bash
hist2geo -s 2023-01-01 takeout-20230501T000000Z-001.zip
``` 
The output will be written to the file `history_2023-01-01.gpx`.

You can also manually extract `Records.json` and use it as parameter. Once extracted this file is quite big (several hundred MB).

## Why? 

I use my travel history to geotag my photos. I often use a tracking application to record my positions, but occasionally (often?) I forget to launch it. In this case, Google Takout (Location history) helps me by extracting my tracks in GPX format.

## Inspiration

This software is strongly inspired by [location-history-json-converter](https://github.com/Scarygami/location-history-json-converter) üôè. But since the pyton application is rather slow, I decided to make one in go that is about  10x faster. The original application is also more complete, I only implemented the features I needed.
