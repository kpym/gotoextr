# gotoextr
Small and dirty program to extract GPX data from [Google Takeout Location History](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/location_history). 

Hence the name: **Go**ogle **T**ake**o**ut Location History **Extr**actor ‚Üí `gotoextr`.

## Usage

### After 2024

1. Download your location history from your phone : Settin ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Location Services ‚Üí Time Line ‚Üí  Export Timeline Data.
2. Run `gotoextr` with the downloaded .json file as argument. For example to extract data for January 1, 2025 run:
```bash
gotoextr -s 2025-01-01 myhistory.json
```

### Before 2024

1. Download your location history from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/location_history) as `zip` archive.
2. Run `gotoextr` with the downloaded archive as argument. For example to extract data for January 1, 2023 run:
```bash
gotoextr -s 2023-01-01 takeout-20230501T000000Z-001.zip
``` 
The output will be written to the file `history_2023-01-01.gpx`.

You can also manually extract `Records.json` and use it as parameter. Once extracted this file is quite big (several hundred MB).

```

## Installation

You can download the latest binary from the [releases](github.com/kpym/gotoextr/releases) page.

Or you can install it from source:
```bash
go install github.com/kpym/gotoextr@latest
```

## Why? 

I use my travel history to geotag my photos. I often use a tracking application to record my positions, but occasionally (often?) I forget to launch it. In this case, Google Takeout (Location history) helps me by extracting my tracks in GPX format.

## How does it work?

This program reads the location history data from a json file and extracts the data for a given date range. The json format exported from the phone is not the same as the one from Google Takeout, but the program can handle both.

For more details on the format of the json file, check the [file format](file_format.md) description.

## Inspiration

This software is strongly inspired by [location-history-json-converter](https://github.com/Scarygami/location-history-json-converter) üôè. But since the python application is rather slow, I decided to make one in go that is about  10x faster. The original application is also more complete, I only implemented the features I needed.
